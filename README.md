## Manhattan-Rolling-Data-Sales

The purpose of the project is to analyze Manhattan housing sales data.  We will mainly focus on housing sales data for one, two, and three family homes. 

The project consists of 3 directories:

1.  The Rdata directory contains a raw file named 2011_manhattan.csv.  It also contains a file named 2011_manhattan_tidy.R which contains the code to clean up the raw file data, format the data and conduct exploratory analysis to remove outliers and missing values to prepare it for analysis.  The tidy data is outputted to 2011_manhattan_tidy.csv.

2.  The Analysis directory contains a file named manhattan_analysis.R.  This file contains the code to generate plots and histograms in order to visulaize and compare the square footage and sales price for housing in Queens.

3.  The paper directory contains a file named manhattan.Rmd, manhattan.md and manhattan.html.  The html file contains the conclusions based on meaninful patterns found through the analysis.  The rmd file contains the code and plots/histograms to support the conclusions made.
